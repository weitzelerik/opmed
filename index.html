                OpMED, LLC was created in the wake of Colonel (retired) Erik Weitzel MD MC USAF's retirement from the military. 
                His career spanned two decades and afforded him a sprawling experience as a Physician/Scientist in the
                US Federal government.  In this role, he functioned as an ENT skullbase surgeon, strategic military
                leader, surgical educator, clinical scientist, laboratory director, Federal grant investor, and human safety/
                ethics oversight authority.  Additionally, his undergraduate and graduate training had a strong emphasis in 
                biomedical engineering and model development.  Now, as a composite of all of these diverse experiences, Dr Weitzel 
                is well-poised to innovate surgical technology, obtain Federal grants for the research and development, 
                achieve FDA approval, and commercialize the technology.

                <u>Non-Invasive Olfactory cleft Sensor for Elevated Intra-Cranial Pressure (NOSE-ICP)</u>:
                <p>A provisional patent has been obtained on a novel device that is blindly inserted into the nasal
                cavity and can determine intracranial pressure through the cribriform plate.  Preliminary data
                shows excellent responsiveness of the device in medium and high fidelity models.  </p>
